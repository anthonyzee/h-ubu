Developer Guide - How to become h-ubuesque
=================================

Compilation and Tests
---------------------------

h-ubu's build system is based on Apache Maven. So to get the final artifacts just issue:

    mvn clean install
    
To run the test in a more convienient way, run:

    mvn jasmine:bdd
    
Then edit your code, and refresh or open (localhost:8234). 

h-ubu's code
--------------

h-ubu's core core is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). This choice was made to reduce the implementation complexity. Coffeescript offers a really nice trade-off: a better syntax and a good OOP design :-). The code is compiled in JavaScript by Maven.

h-ubu's test are based on Jasmine but are mostly written in JavaScript.
