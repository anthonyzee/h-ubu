Testing Components
===============

Principles
------------

Testing components is really simple. You either test the component directly and mock the required services. As the interaciton are contrct-based mocking is really simple. Or, you plug your component or a set of component and test the published services.

Testing with Jasmine
-------------------------

[jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

To test h-ubu components with Jasmine is straigthforward:

    describe("Check my component", function() {
          it("test the published service", function() {
				var component = // ... retrieve the component
				var hub = new HUBU.hub();	// We create a new hub for the test
				hub.registerComponent(component).start();
				
				// Here you can test your component. It's already managed by the hub.	
				
				hub.stop();
	     });
    });

Testing with QUnit
