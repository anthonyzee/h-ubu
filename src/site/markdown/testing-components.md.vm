Testing Components
===============

Principles
------------

Testing components is really simple. You can either test the component directly and mock the required services (as the
interactions are contract-based, mocking is really simple), or else plug in your component - or set of components - and
test the published services.

Testing with Jasmine
-------------------------

[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax
so that you can write tests easily.

Testing H-Ubu components with Jasmine is very straightforward:

    describe("Check my component", function() {
          it("test the published service", function() {
				var component = // ... retrieve the component
				var hub = new HUBU.hub();	// We create a new hub for the test
				hub.registerComponent(component).start();
				
				// Here you can test your component. It's already managed by the hub.	
				
				hub.stop();
	     });
    });

Testing with QUnit
