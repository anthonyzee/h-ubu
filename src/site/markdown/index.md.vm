H-Ubu is a component model for Javascript. Javascript componentization aims to modularize Javascript code in order to
improve the testability, the maintainability and the scalability of Javascript applications. Indeed, Javascript is the
poor-child of web app technologies. The toolset for Javascript is seriously lacking in comparison to the Java toolset.
Unit testing, static analysis and managed execution are totally new for Javascript. However, the flexibility and the
design of the language makes these tools a stringent requirement for code scalability: especially in recent years,
since Javascript has become mainstream and is used by almost all web app stacks. H-Ubu is a component framework for
Javascript, created to address the above issues.

H-UBU's main features
=====================
H-Ubu is a really simple component framework for Javascript. It supports:

* component definition : the code is organized into components
* component injections : components can be injected into other components
* contract-based interactions : components implement and use contracts (i.e. interface)
* synchronous and asynchronous component communication : components can interact using method calls and events
* architecture description : the application is composed by registering components and binding them
* component configuration : components can be configured
* test : components are testable !
* component separation: components are developed in separate files; the application code is then scalable
